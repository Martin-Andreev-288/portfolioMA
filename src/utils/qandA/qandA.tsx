            I was born in Dobrich but grew up in Sofia. Though i currently live
            in Dobrich, i split my time between both cities (i have homes in
            both) and can relocate to Sofia if needed.

            I'm strongly religious, even though that's not very common among
            people of my generation. I love both playing and watching sports. My

            I enrolled in Telerik Academy's JavaScript program with no prior
            coding experience. Despite the steep learning curve, i collaborated
            with teammates to complete projects through relentless effort.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, i still didn't feel ready to start job hunting right after
            the graduation. The job market for junior developers is quite
            competitive now, and i knew i needed more practice. So, i started
            watching tutorials on Udemy and doing exercises to improve my
            skills.
            <br />
            <br />I was later recommended to enroll in the Telerik Academy's
            React Upskill course, which i successfully completed. This course
            introduced me to a lot of new concepts, and after finishing it, i
            decided to practice a bit more before fully diving into job
            applications. I just needed that extra confidence ‚Äî though i know
            there's no way to learn everything beforehand.

            I'm still growing, but my focus is on JavaScript and React ‚Äî tools
            i've come to love, particularly React.
            <br />
            <br />
            My favorite technologies are Tailwind and TypeScript (though my
            relationship with TypeScript is a little bit like "marriage of
            convenience" - occasionally frustrating, but ultimately rewarding!).

            JavaScript is one of the most widely used languages, and React is
            one of the most highly regarded frameworks. Their future looks
            promising ‚Äî just like the career i'm striving for.
            <br />
            <br />
            Also, working with JavaScript and React gives me a few extra
            "jokers" in my hand, such as valuable resources and a strong
            developer community that can help when needed.
            <br />
            <br />
            Most importantly, i love building with React ‚Äî whether it's a
            polished/nicely structured app or a quirky side project. The process
            itself is what excites me.

            I definitely prefer frontend development. It feels a bit more
            intuitive, and i love the satisfaction of seeing my work come to
            life visually.
            <br />
            <br />
            That said, i'm open to backend development as well. If i had the

        question: "What's a technology you're excited to explore next?",
        answer: (
          <>
            First of all, i'm still actively learning the technologies i use
            daily. There's no way to "fully" master any of them since they're
            constantly evolving.
            <br />
            <br />
            That being said, i plan to dive deeper into PostgreSQL and Next.js
            because both are in high demand, align with my goals, and solve
            real-world problems.
            <br />
            <br />
            Of course, i'm always open to learning new tools or technologies if
            needed ‚Äî adaptability is key in this field.

            The idea that you can land a dream tech job after just a few months
            of self-study.
            <br />
            <br />
            I once saw a YouTube comment with hundreds of likes saying, ‚ÄúAfter
            14 months of learning, i quit ‚Äî it's a waste of time.‚Äù I found that
            mindset completely absurd. If it were that easy, then people
            spending years and thousands of dollars on university degrees would
            be complete fools.
            <br />
            <br />
            The truth is, if you want something meaningful and rewarding, you
            have to work for it. Success rarely comes without patience,
            sacrifice, and a lot of effort. The key is to keep pushing forward
            and not give up when things get tough.

        answer: (
          <>
            In my opinion, there is no single 'ideal' workflow, but in general,
            i see the process like this:
            <br />
            <br />
            1. Choose the tech stack ‚Äì Tools that best fit the project's needs.
            <br />
            2. Plan the component structure & UI ‚Äì Roughly define the visual
            layout and design first.
            <br />
            3. Build the static UI ‚Äì Implement the frontend structure without
            state management or logic.
            <br />
            4. Add functionality & state management ‚Äì Integrate state management
            to make everything work.
            <br />
            <br />
            One thing i've learned, though, is that it's almost impossible to
            predict the entire process in advance. Requirements change,
            unexpected challenges arise, and sometimes features need to be
            added, removed, or completely reworked. Being flexible is just as
            important as having a plan.

        question: "How do you troubleshoot when you're stuck?",
        answer: (
          <>
            It depends on the problem, but my process usually goes like this:
            <br />
            <br />
            1. Debug & analyze ‚Äì Try to identify the root cause by debugging and
            checking similar parts of my previous projects.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. Online research ‚Äì if i can't figure it out myself, i look for
            solutions on Stack Overflow, YouTube, or Udemy (since i have a
            subscription there).
            <br />
            <br />
            3. Ask for help ‚Äì Use AI tools or consult experienced developers, if
            possible.
            <br />
            <br />
            4. Take a break ‚Äì Sometimes, the best solution is to step away for a
            while. If it's late, i leave the problem for the next day. More
            often than not, a fresh perspective helps me find the answer much
            faster.

        question:

        answer: (
          <>
            So far, the biggest challenge was implementing Redux Toolkit for the
            first time. Understanding its structure, logic, and best practices
            took a lot of effort.
            <br />
            <br />
            Similarly, configuring Vitest and React Testing Library felt quite
            challenging initially.
            <br />
            <br />
            When you're learning something completely new, it always feels
            overwhelming at first. But once you get past those initial
            struggles, the next challenges start feeling more intuitive.

      },
      {
        question: "What's your way to learn new things?",
        answer: (
          <>
            I usually learn in three ways:
            <br />
            <br />
            - Watching tutorials ‚Äì Udemy, YouTube, or other educational
            platforms.
            <br />
            - Reading documentation ‚Äì Official docs or blog posts.
            <br />
            - Asking experienced developers ‚Äì Insights from experienced devs.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, the most important lesson i've learned is that the best way
            to truly understand something is to apply it in real-world projects.
            Reading and watching videos can only take you so far ‚Äî practical
            experience is what really makes things stick.

        question:
          "What has been the hardest thing for you to learn in programming?",
        answer: (
          <>
            It may sound paradoxical, but the hardest thing for me to learn was
            actually how to learn ‚Äî figuring out the right approach, the best
            resources, the proper workflow, and the most effective ways to apply
            knowledge in practice.
            <br />
            <br />
            Without exaggeration, i believe that nearly half of what makes a
            successful developer is mastering the concept of 'learning how to
            learn.' And from what i've seen, this is something that can never be
            perfected completely.

      {
        question:
          "If you could change something about the programming language or framework you use most often, what would it be?",
        answer: (
          <>
            This might be a bit controversial ‚Äî since having a variety of
            choices is also an advantage ‚Äî but i think there are simply too many
            libraries, tools, and side technologies that a React developer (or
            any developer, really) is expected to learn.
            <br />
            <br />
            This creates a challenge because one company might require a
            specific set of tools, while another might prioritize completely
            different ones. As a result, when applying for jobs, you can't be a
            perfect fit for every position ‚Äî you're only as relevant as the
            specific technologies you're comfortable with.
            <br />
            <br />
            For junior developers, this can feel almost like a nightmare.
            Instead of being judged primarily on problem-solving ability and
            adaptability, the focus often shifts to whether or not you have
            experience with a particular library or tool. It makes the job
            search unnecessarily restrictive.

        question: "Do you prefer working solo or in a team? Why?",
        answer: (
          <>
            In my view, both options have their pros and cons.
            <br />
            <br />
            Working solo means having full control over the project, making
            decisions quickly, and working at your own pace without delays
            caused by others. You don't have to adjust to someone else's
            workflow, which helps avoid potential conflicts.
            <br />
            <br />
            Working in a team exposes you to different perspectives and allows
            you to learn from others, which can be extremely valuable. For
            larger projects, collaboration makes tasks more manageable, and you
            can also count on support when needed.
            <br />
            <br />
            At the end of the day, the best choice depends on the specific
            project and personal preferences. I'm comfortable with both, as long
            as the circumstances make sense.

            course).
            <br />
            <br />
            Jokes aside, the ideal teammate for me would be someone who is
            motivated, shares similar interests, and has a strong desire to
            improve and develop new skills. Ideally, they wouldn't be too
            experienced ‚Äî otherwise, i'd feel like i'm not contributing much to

            and a willingness to learn. I also realize that expecting the
            'perfect' teammate in every situation is unrealistic, so being

            a friendly conversation with the team leader ‚Äî not to demand drastic
            action, of course, but simply to understand the situation better and
            explore ways to help the teammate in a constructive way. The goal
            would be to find a solution that benefits both the individual and

            <br />
            <br />
            I'd love to work on something that aligns with my interests or my
            university background. For example, an app related to geography,
            tourism, or sports would be really exciting. Something in the
            zoology field could also be an interesting challenge.
            <br />

            That being said, i'm open to working on any project that helps me
            develop the skills i need the most. If it allows me to grow as a
            developer, then it's the right project for me.

            At this moment, the most important thing is finding a
            junior-developer-friendly company ‚Äî one that's willing to invest in
            my growth.
            <br />

            In the long run, i'd like to work for a well-established company
            that provides clear career growth opportunities and values
            professional development. A strong culture of teamwork, mentorship,
            and knowledge-sharing would also be a huge plus.
            <br />
            <br />I believe that being in the right environment makes all the
            difference in a developer's journey.

        answer: (

            I'm honestly divided on this topic.
            <br />
            <br />
            On one hand, AI is extremely helpful when used properly ‚Äî it can
            speed up workflows and automate repetitive tasks, making development
            more efficient. But on the other hand, it's true that AI makes
            things more complicated for many people, especially those entering
            the field.
            <br />
            <br />
            That being said, i believe that if you stay motivated, put your
            heart into what you do, and continuously improve your skills, you'll
            always be in demand. No matter how advanced AI becomes, there will
            always be a need for skilled developers who can think critically and
            solve complex problems.
            <br />
            <br />
            History has seen similar fears before ‚Äî like when machines started
            replacing manual labor during the Industrial Revolution. At first,
            it caused drastic concerns, but today, nobody really questions
            whether it was necessary. I think AI will follow a similar path.

        question: "What resources would you recommend for learning to code?",
        answer: (
          <>
            I often use Udemy, YouTube videos, Stack Overflow, official
            documentation related to the specific stack/framework/technology,
            and of course, AI tools.
            <br />
            <br />
            Other platforms like Codecademy, Droidcon Academy, Scrimba, Zero to
            Mastery, DataCamp, Dataquest, Coursera, and Teachable can also be
            beneficial. I haven't tried all of them, but they have a strong
            reputation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Regardless of which resources you rely on, the most important thing
            is to avoid getting stuck in tutorial hell and focus on practicing
            constantly.

        answer: (
          <>
            This is relative, but some key things matter:
            <br />
            <br />
            - Mutual respect and willingness to listen.
            <br />
            - Competency and the ability to explain things clearly.
            <br />
            - Honest, constructive feedback ‚Äî i don't mind criticism; in fact, i
            find it necessary, but it should be given in a way that actually
            helps improvement.
            <br />
            <br />
            A good mentor avoids extremes. He shouldn't write too much code for
            you but also shouldn't say, "I'll never write code." The best
            mentors know when to step in and when to step back ‚Äî they understand
            timing and balance.
            <br />
            <br />
            Also, a mentor should be somewhat of a psychologist ‚Äî not in the
            sense of avoiding honesty, but in knowing how to approach different
            people. Some learners respond well to direct feedback, while others
            need a more patient, step-by-step approach. One size doesn't fit
            all.

            Yes, and i'm really grateful for that. My best friend is a highly
            capable and experienced programmer, and his advice has been
            invaluable to me.
            <br />
            <br />
            That being said, i understand that his willingness to help shouldn't
            be overused or taken for granted. Mentorship should be used wisely ‚Äî
            at the right time and in the right way.

        question:
          "What advice would you give to someone just starting their coding journey?",
        answer: (
          <>
            Some might say it's wrong to talk about your own mistakes, but i
            don't see it that way. If you've learned from them and grown, then
            there's no shame in sharing them to help others avoid the same
            pitfalls.
            <br />
            <br />
            So, here's my biggest advice: Don't make the mistake i did ‚Äî don't
            rely too much on tutorials. Watching tutorials and video lessons is
            useful, but it's not enough on its own. The most important thing is
            to practice and build projects.
            <br />
            <br />
            Also:
            <br />
            - Find a way to get competent feedback ‚Äî it's crucial for
            improvement.
            <br />- Don't get into coding just for the money. Yes, salary is an
            important factor, but if it's your only motivation, you'll struggle
            to stay committed.

            I'd tell myself to work smarter, not just harder.
            <br />
            <br />
            Back then, i thought that spending hours watching tutorials would be
            enough to become a great developer. I'd go back and say: Find the
            right tactics, make a solid learning plan and follow it, avoid
            procrastination but also be patient with your progress.
            <br />
            <br />
            Finally, i'd remind myself that no one can learn everything. There
            will always be technologies, frameworks, or concepts you can't
            master fully. The key is to prioritize what's most valuable for your
            goals and focus on mastering that.

        question:
          "What's a non-tech hobby that indirectly improves your coding skills?",
        answer: (
          <>
            Probably my passion for sports ‚Äî especially football and fitness.
            <br />
            <br />
            Sports have taught me a crucial lesson: you're not defeated when you
            lose a battle or fail to reach a goal in a single day. You're only
            defeated when you lose your eagerness to fight and improve.
            <br />
            <br />
            Life is a mix of wins and losses, and you have to be ready to face
            both with dignity. Right now, coding is my competition ‚Äî but instead
            of fearing the challenges, i choose to respect them and keep pushing
            forward.
            <br />
            <br />
            A simple but powerful mindset i always try to remember: üëâ "If i
            can't do it today, i'll do it soon."
            <br />
            <br />
            The key takeaway is that maybe you won't always achieve your dream
            (or win the trophy, if we make a sports analogy), but as long as
            you're able to fight, move, and breathe ‚Äî don't give up. Not if this
            is what truly matters to you.
