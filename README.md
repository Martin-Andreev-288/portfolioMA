# Welcome to my personal portfolio!

This is my personal developer portfolio — a thoughtfully crafted web app where i showcase my background, skills, and projects. It's built not just as a static resume, but as a dynamic and interactive experience that reflects my personality, journey, and technical growth.

The goal is to give visitors a clean and engaging way to explore who i am, how i think, and what i’ve been building. From a structured Q&A section to project showcases and a contact form, every page is developed with care using modern React practices and strong component architecture.

### Audience:
This portfolio is aimed at potential employers, collaborators, and anyone curious about my development journey. Whether you're a recruiter, mentor, fellow developer, or just passing by — this app is designed to quickly introduce who i am, what i’ve learned, and what i can offer as a developer.
